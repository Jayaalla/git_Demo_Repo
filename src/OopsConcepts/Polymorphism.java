//What is Polymorphism?Different types?
/*Polymorphism is one of the function that allows us to perform 
 *a single action in different ways.
 *Polymorphism is the capability of a method to do different
 *things based on the object tha is acting.
 *Polymorphism allows you define one interface and have multiple
 *implementations.
 *
 * Types of Polymorphism:
 * There are two types of Polymorphsim.
 * 1.Static Polymorphism:Also known as compile time polymorphism.
 *   Method Overloading is one of the ways java supports static
 *   polymorphism.
 * 2.Dynamic Polymorphism:It is process in which a call to an 
 *   Overridden method is resolved at runtime, thats why it is 
 *   called runtime polymorphism.
